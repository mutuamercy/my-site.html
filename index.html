                <p><strong class="title">Title: The Power of Perspective</strong></p>
                <p>Reflecting on moments of growth and change in life often provides a new lens through which to view the world. In one of my most pivotal experiences, I found myself at a crossroads—uncertain of my career path and overwhelmed with doubts. Yet, I soon realized that sometimes, it takes a step back to see the bigger picture.</p>
                <p>As I navigated through the complexities of work, personal life, and self-discovery, I learned that challenges are not barriers but opportunities to evolve. This realization became clearer when I embraced the power of perspective. By reframing my thoughts and choosing a positive outlook, I unlocked new possibilities and embraced my potential for success.</p>
                <p><em>"It is not the challenges we face that define us, but how we choose to face them."</em></p>

                <p><strong class="title">Title: Journey through the Shadows</strong></p>
                <p>Born into a bustling household teeming with siblings, my childhood was a tapestry woven with threads of affection and adversity. My father, a beacon of knowledge as both a headteacher and a music-mathematics aficionado, shared his wisdom, while my mother, a resilient soul tending to the family farm, instilled in us the virtues of perseverance and diligence.</p>
                <p>Tragedy struck like a bolt of lightning on December 24th, 1999, when my mother, a victim of infidelity, departed this world, leaving behind a chasm in our hearts that could never be bridged. Her turbulent struggles—anguish over the loss of her firstborn due to a tragic abortion and betrayal brought on by my father's adultery—exacerbated the agony of her death. As a vulnerable eleven-year-old, I witnessed her secret battles, her spirit destroyed by despair, and her desperate attempts to escape the suffering.</p>
                <p>In the aftermath of her untimely demise, our family fractured, the pieces scattered like shards of glass. My father's remarriage brought a semblance of stability, yet his newfound commitment faltered when it came to fulfilling his paternal obligations, particularly regarding my education. Financial constraints cast a pall over my aspirations, forcing me to abandon my dreams of secondary education after a mere month.</p>
                <p>Seeking solace amidst the chaos, I sought refuge with my aunt, a beacon of hope in a sea of uncertainty. Through her intervention, a glimmer of opportunity emerged—a chance to reclaim my education. With the steadfast support of my cousin, a staunch advocate for learning, my father relented, albeit reluctantly, allowing me to return to school in 2002, albeit with hurdles aplenty.</p>
                <p>Throughout my secondary education, obstacles loomed like specters in the night, threatening to extinguish the flame of my aspirations. My stepmother, resentful of my pursuit of knowledge, sought to thwart my academic endeavours at every turn, withholding resources and burdening me with insurmountable tasks.</p>
                <p>Yet, amid the tempest of adversity, a ray of hope pierced the darkness. With the intervention of child rights authorities and the unwavering support of my cousin, I persevered, completing my secondary education in 2004 with a commendable grade.</p>
                <p>But the journey was far from over. At eighteen, I crossed paths with Kinoti, a man whose promises of a brighter future masked the storm that lurked beneath. Despite the tumultuous relationship and the burden of caring for our daughters, Lynn and Gloria, I pressed on, refusing to succumb to the chaos that threatened to consume me.</p>
                <p>Determined to break free from the shackles of hardship, I seized an opportunity at Angels Hair Collection in Ruiru, Kenya, carving out a semblance of stability for myself and my daughters. After cutting ties with Kinoti and declaring independence, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and strength, motivated by President Obama's inspirational words of resilience during his historic visit to Kenya.</p>
                <p>When Kinoti's abandonment left us teetering on the brink of ruin, I refused to surrender to despair. With the steadfast support of my sister, I reignited the flames of my education, earning certifications in accounting and auditing. I am now pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, despite all the odds against me, thanks to a scholarship from the University of the People.</p>
                <p>Amid my job search struggles, I sought guidance from Father Joseph Mangongo, the parish priest of Githurai in the diocese of Nairobi. Despite the corruption plaguing Caritas Nairobi's recruitment practices, Father Mangongo's unwavering support provided solace and assistance, both emotionally and financially. His compassion and guidance transcended traditional boundaries, earning him the endearing title of "daddy" in my eyes. As I navigate toward a brighter future, Father Mangongo's presence serves as a reminder of the enduring power of kindness and empathy in the face of adversity.</p>
                <p>Through sheer tenacity and the benevolence of individuals like Anthony, who recognized the spark of potential within me, I find myself on the cusp of a brighter tomorrow. Anthony, hailing from Murang'a County, Kenya, and now residing in the U.S., became a pillar of support during my most challenging moments. His belief in me enabled me to continue pursuing my dreams and to embrace the beauty of resilience.</p>

                <p><strong class="title">Title: The Silent Scream</strong></p>
                <p>In the quiet of the night, I hear the sound,</p>
                <p>Of a soul breaking, no one around.</p>
                <p>It’s a silent scream, a cry from within,</p>
                <p>Of a heart that longs to begin again.</p>
                <p>But the world stays still, indifferent and cold,</p>
                <p>As stories of despair and silence unfold.</p>
                <p>And so I wait, in the dark and the rain,</p>
                <p>Hoping tomorrow will ease the pain.</p>
                <p>For in this silence, there's hope to be found,</p>
                <p>Of love, of loss, of the tear-filled sky.</p>
